## Hi there 👋😁

## I'm Ose Matthew, and I am a creative software engineer, mostly into Front end engineering.

## I have strong passion for learning about latest technologies and building tools to help humanity! 🚀.

## I spend most of my time coding 👨🏽‍💻 and when I am not, I am busy playing the piano(ps: i love music 😁) or learning about a new tech feature most especially front end technologies🚀.

## Over the last 5years, I helped several companies take their complex products from concept to market delivery. I can help you do the same.
